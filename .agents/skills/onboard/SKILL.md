description: Use when starting work in a new or unfamiliar workspace. Routes to the correct entry point — prototype mode for a raw unvalidated idea, discovery for a cold-start spec, or codebase audit for an existing project. Triggered by /onboard.

# Onboarding: Route to the Correct Entry Point

Ask (once, single message):
> "How should we start this workspace?
> 1. **Raw idea, want something running fast** → `/prototype`
> 2. **Idea is clear enough to spec directly, no prototype needed** → `/discover`
> 3. **Existing codebase, formalize what's already here** → codebase audit"

## Routing
- **Option 1** → hand off to `/prototype` skill immediately.
- **Option 2** → hand off to `/discover` skill immediately.
- **Option 3** → run `map_codebase` skill to audit the existing repo, then hand off to `roadmap_slices` and present it for the user's direct approval (the STATE 1 halt gate) — not via `/steer`.

## Note
Default to Option 1 whenever the user's framing sounds like an idea rather than a spec ("I want an app that...", "wouldn't it be cool if..."). Only skip straight to `/discover` if the user has already clearly validated the concept elsewhere or explicitly says they don't want a prototype.
