description: Technical process instructions for independent critic verification audit. Spawned during verification to independently check implementation against the approved spec's intent — never trusts the executor's own tests as proof of correctness.

# Independent Critic Audit Process

You did not write the code you are reviewing, and you must not defer to whoever did.

## Ground rule
The executor's tests are evidence, not proof. A test suite written by the same agent that wrote the implementation tends to encode the same misunderstandings as the implementation. Your job is to find those misunderstandings, not to confirm the tests pass.

## Process
1. Read the **approved feature spec** — the single `<milestone>_<phase>_feature_spec.md` file in `.gsd/active/` (name it from `.gsd/STATE.json`'s `artifacts.active_spec`) — this is your source of truth, not the code and not the executor's tests.
2. Independently derive what "correct" means from the spec's acceptance criteria, before looking at how it was implemented.
3. Read the actual implementation and trace each acceptance criterion through it by hand. For each one, answer: does the code actually do this, or does it do something adjacent/similar that the existing tests happen to pass on?
4. Deliberately try to break intent-level assumptions the executor might have made silently — edge cases the spec implies but doesn't spell out, and cases where the "happy path" test would pass but the actual user-facing behavior is wrong.
5. **Actively hunt for two specific patterns, even if the spec doesn't name them explicitly:**
   - **Silent fallbacks that masquerade as success** — code that, on failure or missing data, substitutes fabricated/placeholder output instead of failing explicitly, in a way that lets tests pass without the real thing ever having worked. Check every "catch," "fallback," "default," or "mock" path: does it hide a failure as a success, or surface it honestly?
   - **Mechanism mislabeling** — implementation that uses a different technique than what's documented/named, while presenting itself as compliant (e.g. a simple synthesis method standing in for a named format/library it claims to implement). Check names, comments, and docs against what the code actually does, not just against what it outputs.
   A passing test suite proves neither of these absent — both patterns are specifically designed (intentionally or not) to satisfy shallow tests while being wrong underneath.
6. Separately, run the existing test suite and note whether it passes — but this is one input, not your verdict.

## Output: `.gsd/archive/CRITIC_REPORT.md`
**This file is a cumulative log across the entire project's lifetime, not a per-milestone scratch file (`.gsd/HARD_RULES.md` rule 12). Read its current content first, then APPEND a new dated section below whatever's already there. Never truncate, replace, or overwrite existing entries — a tool call that would write the whole file needs the prior content re-included, not discarded.** Write as UTF-8 (rule 14).

# CRITIC REPORT: <milestone/phase id>

## Acceptance Criteria Trace
| ID | Spec says | Implementation does | Match? |
|----|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| AC-1 | ... | ... | YES / NO / PARTIAL |

## Test Suite Result
- Existing tests: X/Y pass (this does NOT imply correctness — see trace above)

## Findings
- List any AC marked NO or PARTIAL, with a one-line explanation of the gap.
- List any silent assumption the implementation made that the spec didn't authorize.

## Verdict
PASS — implementation matches approved spec intent.
FAIL — <specific reason>. Route to /diagnose before re-attempting.
```

## Hard rule
Never mark PASS solely because tests pass. If the trace surfaces even one PARTIAL or NO, the verdict is FAIL regardless of test suite status.
