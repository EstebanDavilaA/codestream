# FEATURE SPECIFICATION: M{X}_P{Y} - [Feature Name]

## Phase Summary
[Concise summary of phase goals, motivation, and user-visible mechanics]

### Key Behaviors
1. [Key Behavior 1]
2. [Key Behavior 2]

### Resolved Ambiguities (Binding)
- **Operator Precision & Boundaries**: [e.g. `>=` vs `>`, exact inclusive/exclusive float bounds e.g. `[-20.0, 0.5]` vs `-20.01` / `0.51`]
- **Gate Interplay**: [e.g. Replaces/augments temporal gate, rendering window vs focus window separation]
- **Fallback Retention**: [e.g. When zero qualifying items match, retain prior state values rather than leaking default placeholders]
- **Transition Mechanics**: [e.g. Animated fast lerp vs same-frame teleport, exact thresholds and lerp factors]

### Out of Scope (Explicit Exclusions, Binding)
- [Something a reader might reasonably expect this phase to cover, named explicitly as deferred — and to which milestone/phase, if known. e.g. "Retry/backoff on failed writes — deferred to M6_P1, this phase assumes writes succeed."]
- [A component or file adjacent to this work that stays untouched on purpose. e.g. "The legacy `formatLegacyDate()` path is not migrated in this phase — new call sites only."]

This section exists to shrink the implementation's "creative area" as much as the Resolved Ambiguities above do — everything decided in scope by inclusion, everything decided out of scope by name. An empty section is a signal the phase's boundary wasn't actually thought through, not evidence there's nothing to exclude. `critic` (Layer 2) treats an item listed here as authorized non-work, not a gap — and treats material scope creep *beyond* what's listed here as its own finding.

## 1. Data Schema & Contracts
- **Exported Constants & Types**: [e.g., `CAMERA_JUMP_THRESHOLD: 3.0`, interfaces, exported types]
- **Symbol Inventory**: [Explicit list of modified symbols and existing untouched symbols]

---

## 2. Transformations & Pure Logic
- **Pure Function Contracts**: [Signatures, default arguments, deterministic inputs -> outputs]
- **No-Match / Fallback Contracts**: [Explicit return values on empty/zero match, caller branching rules]
- **Stateful Integration Contract**: [Step-by-step logic integration in render/frame loop, lerp selection, lockstep component updates]
- **Refactoring & Legacy Cleanup**: [Explicitly identify obsolete registration paths, legacy alias loops, or side effects to be purged]

## 3. Acceptance Criteria & Test Matrix
| ID | Requirement | Test Type | Expected Outcome |
|----|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| AC-1 | Constant Exports | Unit Test | `CONSTANT === value`, imported cleanly |
| AC-2 | Basic Logic Below Threshold | Unit Test | Deterministic boolean / value outcome |
| AC-3 | Basic Logic Above Threshold | Unit Test | Deterministic boolean / value outcome |
| AC-4 | Exact Boundary Edge Case | Unit Test | Inclusive/exclusive exact float boundary assertion |
| AC-5 | Multi-Element & Spans | Unit Test | Span calculations, padding, bounds |
| AC-6 | Degenerate & Empty Inputs | Unit Test | Zero items / empty array handling |
| AC-7 | Stateful Frame Integration | Integration Test | Integration behaviour in stateful container |
| AC-8 | Fallback Preservation | Integration Test | Prior state retained across zero-match frames |
| AC-9 | Lockstep Sync | Integration Test | Dual component sync (e.g. camera and spotlight) |
| AC-10 | Invariant Preservation | Integration Test | Unrelated features/windows remain unaffected |
| AC-11 | Scope Guardrail | Verification | `git diff --name-only` confirms specified files are untouched |
