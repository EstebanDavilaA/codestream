# Extract Template: Propagate Framework Improvements Upstream

**Rule:** This project's `.claude/`, `.agents/`, and `.gsd/HARD_RULES.md`/`.gsd/templates/` are a downstream, battle-tested copy of this project's upstream framework template — **fill in the template name and absolute path here when you adopt this skill into a project** (e.g. "the SLIPSTREAM template at `/path/to/Templates/SLIPSTREAM`"). When this project refines the framework itself (a new skill, a hardened agent prompt, a new hard rule, a corrected spec template), that improvement is only useful to future projects once it's copied back upstream. This skill does that copy — diff first, scrub project-specific content, get explicit approval, then write. It never commits or pushes inside the template repo on its own initiative.

This is framework tooling, not a project feature — it is exempt from the `SPEC_APPROVED` lifecycle (`CLAUDE.md` rule 1 governs app code; this skill never touches `apps/`, `packages/`, or app-level `.gsd/` runtime state). Treat it like rule 7's lightweight-task exception: no spec, no critic, no steering log entry. Just diff, confirm, write.

## Non-negotiables

1. **Never write to the template repo without showing the user a diff-based summary first and getting explicit approval.** The template repo is a separate git repository (`<template root>/.git`) outside this project — writing to it is exactly the class of "affects a system beyond the local task" action that needs confirmation before, not after.
2. **Never run `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push` inside the template repo.** Leave the working tree changed and let the user review (`git -C <template> status`/`diff`) and commit themselves, unless they explicitly ask you to commit for them in this same conversation.
3. **Never delete a template-only file or directory** (something the template has that the project doesn't) without calling it out and getting explicit confirmation — it may be intentionally generic scaffolding the project simply hasn't needed yet, not something to prune to match the project.
4. **Check the template repo's own working tree state before touching it.** If `git -C <template> status --short` already shows uncommitted changes, surface them to the user before proceeding — you could otherwise be copying on top of the user's own in-progress template edits, or your diff could be misleadingly attributed to this project when some of it is already-uncommitted template work.
5. **Never copy project-identifying content verbatim.** Scrub before proposing (see "Genericize before proposing" below).

## Scope — what counts as "template material"

Compare only these paths between the project root and the template root. Anything else in the project is either app code or project-runtime state, not framework material.

**In scope (diff and propose):**
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `.gsd/HARD_RULES.md`
- `.gsd/templates/**` (spec/roadmap/state-schema/steering-checkpoint templates)
- `.claude/skills/**/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/agents/**/*.md`
- `.agents/AGENTS.md`
- `.agents/skills/**/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/workflows/**/*.md` — legacy structure. If the project has deleted files here in favor of `.agents/skills/`, that is a **structural** change to propose (retire the workflow file and confirm/create its `.agents/skills/` counterpart in the template), not a content diff to ignore because the file is "just gone."

**Out of scope (never diff or touch):**
- `.gsd/STATE.json`, `.gsd/ROADMAP.md`, `.gsd/DISCOVERY.md`, `.gsd/BUGS.md`, `.gsd/FEATURES.md`, `.gsd/active/**`, `.gsd/archive/**`, `.gsd/documents/**`, `.gsd/scratch/**` — this project's runtime state, never template content.
- `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/settings.local.json` — contains this machine/project's literal paths and permission allowlist, not generic framework config.
- `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore` at the project root — project packaging, not framework. (The template's own `README.md` documents the framework and is edited directly in the template repo, not derived from the project's.)
- `apps/`, `packages/`, and everything else that is the actual application.

If the user asks to extract something outside this default scope (e.g. a specific `.gsd/templates` addition that isn't listed, or a genuinely reusable snippet from README.md), treat that as an explicit one-off addition to the scope for this run — call it out in the summary like any other proposed change.

## Process

1. **Resolve paths.** Project root = current working directory. Template root = **fill in your project's template path here** unless the user names a different template location. Confirm both exist.

2. **Check template repo cleanliness first** (non-negotiable 4). Run `git -C <template> status --short`. If it's dirty, show the user what's already changed there before your own diff, so they aren't confused about provenance later.

3. **Diff in-scope paths.** For each path in scope:
   - File exists in both, content differs → **candidate update**.
   - File exists in project only → **candidate addition**.
   - File exists in template only → **leave alone**, just note it exists (never a candidate for deletion without separate explicit confirmation per non-negotiable 3).
   - A whole directory concept changed (e.g. `.agents/workflows/` emptied out, `.agents/skills/` populated) → **candidate structural change**, described in prose, not just a file list.

   Before trusting any diff, normalize line endings on both sides (e.g. compare with a CRLF/LF-stripped diff) — a file that only differs by line-ending convention is not a content change and is not a candidate. Also don't assume the project's copy is the newer one: compare actual content and, when in doubt, file mtimes on both sides — the template may have been refined independently since this project last synced from it, in which case the project's copy is stale relative to the template, not ahead of it, and should not be pushed up.

4. **Genericize before proposing.** Before adding any project → template change to the summary, scan the actual diff text (not just the filename) for project-identifying content and strip or generalize it:
   - The project's own name/brand (e.g. its product name) and domain vocabulary specific to its problem space, used as if they were generic framework language.
   - Hardcoded absolute paths specific to this machine/project (e.g. `/home/user/Projects/<project-name>/...`).
   - Emails, usernames, or other personal identifiers.
   - Concrete milestone numbers/examples (`M42`, `M37_P2`) used as illustrative text in agent/skill prompts — replace with a generic placeholder or a different, clearly-labeled example if the surrounding prose needs one.
   - App-specific package/path conventions (`apps/web`, `apps/api`) *unless* the template already documents that exact monorepo layout as its convention — check before assuming it needs stripping.

   If a diff is genuinely generic framework improvement (a new hard rule, a corrected process step, a new skill with no project-specific content), it needs no scrubbing — most hard-rule and skill-process changes will be like this.

5. **Present the summary before writing anything.** Group by file, one line per candidate change:
   ```
   UPDATE  .gsd/HARD_RULES.md         — adds rules 16–21 (generic, no scrubbing needed)
   ADD     .claude/skills/log/SKILL.md — new skill, ported from Gemini side per rule 16
   STRUCTURAL .agents/workflows/*.md → .agents/skills/*/SKILL.md — project retired workflows/ in favor of skills/; template still has both
   SKIP    CLAUDE.md "Project-specific context" section — project-specific, not propagated
   ```
   Ask the user to approve the whole batch, approve a subset, or adjust. Do not write until they respond.

6. **Apply approved changes.** Copy file contents (or hand-edit for partial/scrubbed diffs) into the template repo at the matching path. For `.gsd/templates/STATE_SCHEMA_TEMPLATE.json` or any other JSON file, read-parse-mutate-serialize rather than text-splicing (same discipline as `CLAUDE.md` rule 17, applied here because it's the same failure mode). Create new directories as needed for additions.

7. **Verify and report.** Re-run `git -C <template> status --short` and `git -C <template> diff --stat` and show the user what actually landed. Remind them the template repo's changes are uncommitted — they review and commit (or discard) at their own pace; this skill does not do it for them.
