name: steer
description: Use after /execute halts on a clean Layer 1 pass. (Roadmap approval is NOT handled here — /map and /promote halt for that themselves, since /steer opens by auditing a build against an approved spec and at roadmap time neither exists.) Runs Layer 2 (critic audit) and Layer 3 (regression) itself, then presents state of the union and steering options, then halts. Never advances automatically.

# State 4: Steering Checkpoint

**Rule:** Never close context or advance automatically after this point, regardless of how clear the "obvious next step" seems. This is a mandatory human checkpoint — but the checkpoint is the halt itself, not a prerequisite for reaching it. `/execute` now halts after Layer 1 rather than auto-chaining forward, so `/steer` is the normal user-invoked next step: it runs Layer 2/3 itself and then, on a clean pass, presents the checkpoint **in that same turn** (`.gsd/HARD_RULES.md` rule 15). "Ready to proceed" is not compliant with this skill — presenting the actual options block below is.

## What to do
0. **First action of a session, always**: if `.gsd/STATE.json` already exists, run the pre-flight integrity check (`.gsd/HARD_RULES.md` rule 10) before anything else. `/steer` is now the normal entry point right after `/execute` halts — it is no longer a same-turn continuation from `/verify` (rule 15).
1. **Layer 2 — Independent critic audit.** Spawn the `critic` subagent with the approved spec for this milestone/phase, in this fresh context (deliberately not carrying the executor's build transcript forward — that compounding was the token-burn problem this reorg fixes). It re-derives acceptance criteria from the spec and traces them through the implementation without trusting the executor's tests. Wait for `.gsd/archive/CRITIC_REPORT.md`, then read it back and confirm the new dated entry is actually there before citing it (rule 19).
2. **Layer 3 — Cross-milestone regression.** Run the smoke tests for every previously completed milestone, not just the current one.
3. **Verdict logic:**
   - Layer 2 FAIL → do NOT hand this back to `executor` for a quick patch. Route to `/diagnose` — a critic FAIL usually means either the spec was ambiguous or the implementation approach itself is wrong.
   - Layer 3 regression → route to `/diagnose` as well.
   - Both clear → compile `.gsd/archive/VERIFICATION_REPORT.md` (append a new dated section, rule 12) and continue to step 4 in the same turn — do not stop and wait for a separate trigger (rule 15).
4. Spawn the `verifier` subagent to summarize what just completed and write `.gsd/archive/STEERING_LOG.md` (append a new dated section — never overwrite, rule 12).
5. Present, filling `<phase status>` from `.gsd/ROADMAP.md`'s "Estimated phases" line for the active milestone against `.gsd/STATE.json`'s `active_phase` (e.g. "phase 1 of an estimated 2 — at least one more phase expected", "phase 2 of an estimated 2 — this is likely the closing phase", or "estimate still unclear, planner will scope it at the next /plan" if the line says TBD):
```
[STATE 4: Steering Checkpoint]

State of the Union: <one or two sentences on what's done and verified>

Milestone progress: <phase status>

Please choose:
- Option A (Refine): submit comments/adjustments on the current phase.
- Option B (Proceed Phase): advance to the next phase in the active milestone.
- Option C (Pivot Roadmap): adjust future milestones based on what was learned.
- Option D (Complete): mark this milestone complete, move to the next one.
```
Do not silently treat "Estimated phases" as authoritative — it is `planner`'s current best guess (`.claude/agents/roadmapper.md` point 6), not a guarantee. Option B stays available even past the estimated count, and Option D stays available before it, if that's what the user's work actually calls for.
6. Halt. Wait for an explicit selection. Do not invoke any code-editing tool on workspace source files while waiting.

## Option action handlers — run the exact steps below once the user responds

- **Option A (Refine current phase)**:
  1. Record the choice and the user's notes in `.gsd/archive/STEERING_LOG.md` (append).
  2. Do NOT archive `.gsd/active/<milestone>_<phase>_feature_spec.md`.
  3. Do NOT edit implementation source files.
  4. Do NOT advance the phase counter or jump to `/plan` for the next phase.
  5. Update the active feature spec in `.gsd/active/` to incorporate the user's refinement comments into acceptance criteria or contracts.
  6. Present the updated spec and **halt**: *"Review the revised feature specification. Reply with SPEC_APPROVED to begin execution."* Do not call `/execute` or edit code until `SPEC_APPROVED` is explicitly received.

- **Option B (Proceed Phase)**:
  1. Record the choice in `.gsd/archive/STEERING_LOG.md` (append).
  2. Archive the current feature spec from `.gsd/active/` to `.gsd/archive/specs/` (same filename, no rename needed) and move `.gsd/active/manual_verification/` contents to `.gsd/archive/manual_verification/<milestone>_<phase>/`.
  3. Update status of addressed bugs (`BUG-xxx` in `.gsd/BUGS.md`) and features (`FEAT-xxx` in `.gsd/FEATURES.md`) to `CLOSED`.
  4. Increment the phase counter in `.gsd/STATE.json`'s `active_phase`, and add an `"agent"` field to the new `state_history` entry (rule 11).
  5. Trigger `/plan` for the next phase of the active milestone.
  6. Present the new phase spec and **halt** for `SPEC_APPROVED`.

- **Option C (Pivot Roadmap)**:
  1. Record the choice in `.gsd/archive/STEERING_LOG.md` (append).
  2. Spawn the `roadmapper` subagent to revise `.gsd/ROADMAP.md` based on what was learned, inspecting `.gsd/FEATURES.md` and `.gsd/BUGS.md` for candidate items and updating their status to `SCHEDULED_MILESTONE (Milestone X)`.
  3. Present the updated roadmap and **halt** for user approval before entering `/plan`.

- **Option D (Complete Milestone)**:
  1. Record the choice in `.gsd/archive/STEERING_LOG.md` (append).
  2. Archive the current feature spec and manual-verification evidence (same steps as Option B.2). Update status of addressed bugs and features to `CLOSED`.
  3. Update `.gsd/STATE.json` and `.gsd/ROADMAP.md` to mark the active milestone complete.
  4. **Archive `state_history` by milestone boundary** (`.gsd/HARD_RULES.md` rule 21): read `.gsd/STATE.json`, split off every `state_history` entry belonging to milestones older than the milestone that just closed and the one before it, append those entries as a new dated section to `.gsd/archive/STATE_HISTORY.md` (append-only, rule 12), and write `STATE.json` back with only the current-and-prior-milestone entries retained — through the read-parse-mutate-serialize-reparse discipline of rule 17, never a text splice. Skip this step if the combined entry count for those two milestones is still small (no fixed threshold — use judgment; the goal is keeping `STATE.json` a quick read, not archiving on every close).
  5. Advance to the next milestone in `.gsd/ROADMAP.md` (Phase 1).
  6. Trigger `/plan` for Milestone+1 Phase 1, present the spec, and **halt** for `SPEC_APPROVED`.

## Note
If Layer 2 (critic) or Layer 3 (regression), run in step 1-3 above, comes back FAIL/regressed, the steering checkpoint (steps 5-6) never gets presented — route to `/diagnose` instead. `/steer` should only ever present genuinely completed, verified work.
