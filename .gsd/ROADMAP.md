# ROADMAP: [PROJECT NAME]

## Executive Summary & Product Vision
[Summary of product vision derived from resolved State 0 Discovery]

## Architectural Decoupling Principles
1. **Layer Separation:** Data contracts, core logic, presentation/rendering, and integrations are strictly isolated.
2. **Reversibility Principle:** Choices in later milestones must not force refactoring of earlier milestone structures.

## Milestone Sequence

### Milestone 1: Data Contracts & Pure Interfaces
- **Objective:** Define foundational data types, schemas, and state contracts.
- **Independent Deliverable:** Validated, testable schema definitions and data interfaces.
- **Boundary Interface:** Pure data contracts consumed by Milestone 2.
- **Verification Threshold:** 100% schema validation pass & contract test coverage.

### Milestone 2: Core Logic Engine & Transformations
- **Objective:** Build deterministic business logic, state reducers, and core calculation engines.
- **Independent Deliverable:** Fully unit-tested logic engine with zero UI coupling.
- **Boundary Interface:** Functions taking Milestone 1 contracts and returning state outputs.
- **Verification Threshold:** 100% unit test passage for all pure transformations.

### Milestone 3: Visual Presentation & Component Binding
- **Objective:** Implement user interface components, functional layouts, and visual rendering.
- **Independent Deliverable:** Interactive UI components bound to core logic engine.
- **Boundary Interface:** Event listeners and state display subscribers.
- **Verification Threshold:** Visual/UI acceptance criteria and component integration tests.

### Milestone 4: External Integrations & Advanced Interactivity
- **Objective:** Wire external services, persistence drivers, and real-world I/O handlers.
- **Independent Deliverable:** Complete end-to-end operational software.
- **Boundary Interface:** Driver implementations of core integration interfaces.
- **Verification Threshold:** End-to-end integration test suite passage.
